Developers building with Ethers.js gain comprehensive access to the Ethereum blockchain, enabling them to perform various tasks such as querying blocks and wallets, resolving ENS addresses, establishing direct connections to nodes, and more. With its extensive capabilities, Ethers.js has become a go-to choice for over 18,000 Web3 projects on GitHub, showcasing its widespread adoption within the Ethereum development community.



Web3.py is a Python library designed for connecting decentralized applications (DApps) with the Ethereum blockchain. It empowers developers to interact with the Ethereum network, enabling tasks such as sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, and retrieving block data. Derived directly from the Web3.js JavaScript API, Web3.py is tailored to meet the specific needs of Python developers, making it an excellent choice for building Ethereum-based applications using Python programming language.
