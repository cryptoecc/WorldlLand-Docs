# Web3 Libraries

Worldland is an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network, allowing the utilization of the following dApp libraries commonly used in Ethereum. Developers can leverage these frameworks to build and develop dApps on the Worldland network. The frameworks offer powerful functionalities such as smart contract interaction, event subscriptions, and blockchain data retrieval, enabling the creation of sophisticated dApps on the Worldland platform.

Developers building with Ethers.js gain comprehensive access to the Ethereum blockchain, enabling them to perform various tasks such as querying blocks and wallets, resolving ENS addresses, establishing direct connections to nodes, and more. With its extensive capabilities, Ethers.js has become a go-to choice for over 18,000 Web3 projects on GitHub, showcasing its widespread adoption within the Ethereum development community.



Web3.js is a widely-used TypeScript/JavaScript library that facilitates interaction between decentralized applications (DApps) and the Ethereum blockchain. Its primary purpose is to simplify the process of connecting DApps with Ethereum blockchain data. Through its modular libraries, developers can seamlessly interact with smart contracts, treating them as TypeScript/JavaScript objects. Additionally, Web3.js enables subscription to on-chain events, direct retrieval of block states from Ethereum nodes, and more. In version 4, the library underwent a complete rewrite in TypeScript, introducing new features such as Plugins. With over 500,000 weekly downloads, Web3.js is highly popular and trusted by industry-leading projects, including Truffle.



Web3.py is a Python library designed for connecting decentralized applications (DApps) with the Ethereum blockchain. It empowers developers to interact with the Ethereum network, enabling tasks such as sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, and retrieving block data. Derived directly from the Web3.js JavaScript API, Web3.py is tailored to meet the specific needs of Python developers, making it an excellent choice for building Ethereum-based applications using Python programming language.
