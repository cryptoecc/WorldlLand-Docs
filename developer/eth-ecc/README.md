ETH-ECC is one of the clients of the Ethereum blockchain. This client is an additional implementation of ECCPoW (Error-Correction Code Proof of Work), the consensus algorithm of the Worldland blockchain.&#x20;



ECCPoW is a consensus algorithm that utilizes error-correcting code (Shore Darius Error-Correcting Code, LDPC code) to perform block generation proof-of-work. It solves the problem through LDPC code decoding, which improves the performance of nodes involved in block generation and strengthens the security of the blockchain.&#x20;



ETH-ECC connects Seoul Mainnet and Gwangju Testnet between Ethereum and Worldland blockchains to support interaction. It operates as an EVM-based client compatible with Ethereum, and through this, the movement of information and assets between the two blockchains can be performed smoothly.



&#x20;ETH-ECC using ECCPoW contributes to increasing the stability and reliability of the network and can generate blocks more efficiently than the existing PoW method. It enables the enhancement of blockchain interoperability and various uses of existing smart contracts and DApps and can provide beneficial results to the Ethereum and Worldland blockchain communities.
