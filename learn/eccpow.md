# ECCPoW

### Why we made it?

Today, mining modules investing heavily on state-of-the art ASIC miners appear. The bitcoin network is left with only handful of these modules. This shows the current bitcoin network is centralized, leading to that the immuntability of the blockchain lies.

So, We needs new time-variant PoW. Basically, ASICs are useful when crypto puzzles ar not changeable. To make ASICs useless, our solution way is to make crypto puzzles time-variant. We call our solution ECCPoW.

* Development of Synthetic Function of SHA and LDPC Decoder
* Parity Check Matrix (PCM) size and amount of required resources (mem, comp) can be changed.
* PCM can change the value of each block by inputting the hash value of the previous block.
