# How WorldLand Works

WorldLand operates as a decentralized global mainnet, aiming for decentralization at the level of one vote per registered wallet address. The platform allows for Know Your Customer (KYC) verification to be applied during the registration process for a wallet address. Initially, a small number of groups form the network, but over time, the goal is to facilitate the participation of numerous individual nodes.

As more individual nodes join the network, the influence of the initial nodes is designed to decrease naturally, ensuring a more distributed and decentralized network. WorldLand strives to prevent the concentration of nodes in specific areas and aims for an even distribution across the world's oceans and continents.

Participating nodes play crucial roles in the WorldLand ecosystem:

* **Collecting transactions**: Nodes gather transactions to create blocks on the blockchain.
* **Verifying blocks**: Nodes verify the blocks created by other nodes to prevent double-spending and ensure the integrity of the blockchain.
* **Channeling energy**: Nodes contribute a certain amount of energy to the blockchain, enhancing the network's resistance against attacks.
* **Computing resources**: Nodes provide computing resources such as CPU, GPU, storage space, and internet connectivity. These resources are utilized for tasks like zero-knowledge proof computations and participation in cloud services required for My AI Agent learning and reasoning services.

Nodes form the backbone of the blockchain network and play an essential role in its protection and functioning. In return for their participation and successful block issuance, nodes are granted the exclusive right to cast coins. The reward system for performing useful work delegates authority based on the terms of smart contracts distributed on the network, ensuring compliance with contract terms between users and performers.

Overall, WorldLand incentivizes and empowers participating nodes to contribute to the network's consensus algorithm while providing valuable services and resources, creating a decentralized and secure ecosystem.
