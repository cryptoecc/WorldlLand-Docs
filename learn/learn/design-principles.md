# Design Principles

The WorldLand platform is designed with simplicity, decentralization, and security as its core principles. It aims to address the issues of re-centralization and scalability without compromising on decentralization or security. This means that the platform avoids reducing the number of participating nodes or adopting algorithms that require excessive inter-node communication.

Features of the WorldLand Platform:

* Green VCA (formerly ECCPoW) based entities are organized into multiple layers.
* It enables the implementation of various functions and roles by connecting blockchains with different purposes.
* However, the platform cannot be supported as a single-chain solution and requires ecosystem evolution through natural consumer selection.

#### **Key Performance Indicators**

The Green VCA Matrix is evaluated based on the following key performance metrics:

&#x20;    **M1. PQ Secure Encryption and Consensus**

&#x20;    **M2. Energy Consumption Efficiency (ECE)**

&#x20;    **M3. Byzantine Fault Tolerance (1/2)**

&#x20;    **M4. Unchangeable Currency Issuance Schedule**

&#x20;    **M5. Block Creation Time (average 10 seconds)**

&#x20;    **M6. Block Size (1 Mbyte)**

&#x20;

#### Green VCA Matrix

The Green VCA Matrix aims to address Post Quantum (PQ) security and environmental concerns while maintaining security, decentralization, and time-energy assets. It utilizes new technological advancements to achieve these goals. The matrix consists of two main components: the Verifiable Coin Toss Function (VCT) for self-election and a new Proof-of-Computation (PC) primitive. Existing PoolResistantComp algorithms can support this process. The PC part incorporates the Error Correcting Code Proof-of-Work (ECCPoW) algorithm, which is a newly published anti-ASIC technology. Additionally, the platform enhances the components of the virtual machine, particularly by replacing elliptic curve cryptography with PQ-safe cryptography.
