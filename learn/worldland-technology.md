# WorldLand Technology

WorldLand aims to tackle two critical challenges in blockchain technology through the utilization of the Green VCA blockchain approach. The first challenge involves countering the potential centralization caused by ASIC mining. This is addressed by implementing a new Error Correction Code Proof-of-Work (ECCPoW) algorithm. The second challenge is to create a blockchain ecosystem that prioritizes decentralization, security, and scalability.

While there are existing solutions available to address scalability issues in blockchain, the Green VCA blockchain approach focuses on overcoming these challenges without compromising decentralization and security. To achieve this, the SHA-based proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm is replaced with the ECCPoW algorithm. PoW remains a fundamental aspect of open blockchains within the Green VCA framework.

The utilization of Error Correction Code within the Green VCA blockchain approach addresses the potential errors that can occur during information transmission through communication channels like the Internet and wireless communication. Error Correction Code is a mathematical method that allows receivers to correct erroneous received information. By adding a code bit during transmission, the receiver can autonomously correct errors using the provided code scheme. The ability to correct errors depends on the code used, with more sign bits enabling the correction of a higher number of errors. The receiver's operations also increase to correct a greater number of errors.

WorldLand is the first technology to integrate error correction code as a means of Green VCA within the blockchain. The algorithm determines the number of error correction codes to be used, creates a puzzle problem of a specified difficulty level according to a defined procedure, and announces it in the block header. The difficulty of the puzzle can be finely adjusted based on the number of error correction targets, allowing for flexible adjustment of the computation required for network security.

Within the WorldLand platform, based on the Green VCA consensus protocol, a large-scale peer-to-peer network of nodes participates in block generation to ensure decentralization. The use of a time-varying cryptographic puzzle method enhances security against double-spend attacks (DS attacks), while also increasing decentralization and reducing energy consumption through ASIC resistance.
