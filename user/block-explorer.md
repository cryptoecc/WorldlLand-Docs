### **What can I do with** Block Explorer**?**

* **Deep Search**: Find all the information you need on [Blocks](broken-reference), Transactions, Tags and more through the integrated search box.
* **Interact with Contracts**: [Read and write to contracts](broken-reference) directly from the Blockscout UI.
* **Verify Contracts:**  Use [Hardhat](broken-reference), [Sourcify](broken-reference), and other tools to quickly verify  contracts.
* **Make API Calls**: Make requests to a [robust API](broken-reference) using standard and customized endpoints.
* **Customize Views**: Use the [My Account](broken-reference) features to add tags, watchlists and other features.



### **Key Features**

* **Open source development**: The code is community driven and available for anyone to use, explore, and improve.
* **Broad multi-chain ecosystem support**: Blockscout supports Ethereum mainnet, EVM forks like Ethereum Classic, Celo, & Gnosis Chain, Polkadot Parachains, Cosmos ecosystem, optimistic rollups, and many additional public and private EVM networks. [See the list](broken-reference)
* **Real time transaction tracking**: Transactions are updated in real time - no page refresh required. Infinite scrolling is also enabled.
* **Smart contract interaction**: Users can read and verify Solidity & Vyper smart contracts and access pre-existing contracts to fast-track development.&#x20;
* **Token support**: Support for ERC20 and ERC721 tokens.
* **Decoded views:** Contract method calls and logs are decoded to provide additional information within the UI.
* **Full-featured API:** GraphQL provides the opportunity to test API calls directly from a web interface, and RPC methods are well documented.
* **User customization**: Users can easily deploy on a network and customize the Bootstrap-based interface.
* **Modular and extendible**: We're building next generation modularity into Blockscout with Rust-designed microservices
